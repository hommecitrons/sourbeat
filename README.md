# sourbeat

A mini RPN programming language for bytebeat programs.

It supports all C arithmetic operators, with `<` being shift left and `>` being shift right.

Music is generated by repeatedly evaluating the program, with the variable `t` incremented each time.

Variables can be assigned to via the `:` operator. 
For example, `t 2 * :a` assigns `t * 2` to `a`.

## usage

Compile the program with `make` and either pass a source file as an argument, or pipe it into stdin.
